# Stock prediction using RNN (LSTM and BiLSTM)

In this approach, the goal was to predict stock prices using a Recurrent Neural Networks, RNN. 
For this purpose, several model architectures for stock price forecasting were presented. Also, tried to test different model parameters such as number of layers, nodes and drop outs and fit over several batch size, epoch size, optimizer and different activation functions to determine the effect of different parameters in accuracy of the model.
With proper layers and hyper parameters, the LSTM and the Bi-LSTM models should give good results for stock prediction.

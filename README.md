# stock-prediction-using-lstm

In this approach, the goal was to predict stock prices using a recursive artificial neural networks, RNN. 
For this purpose, several model architectures for stock price forecasting were presented. Also, tried to test different model parameters such as number of layers, nodes and drop outs and fitting over several batch size, epoch size, optimizer and different activation functions to determine the effect of different parameters in accuracy of the model prediction. 
Here ,the LSTM models had better stock predictions, but with proper layers and hyper parameters, the Bi-LSTM model should also give good results
